# OneByteRadar
CS:GO radar hack achieved by patching one byte of game memory. Written in Python 3.


## Getting started

### Prerequisites
Python 3 and `pymem` package need to be installed in order to run OneByteRadar.

### Running
Run CS:GO, then start OneByteRadar.py either by double-clicking it or typing `python OneByteRadar.py` command.
Although program exists immediately, hack works as long as game's running.
To **disable** the hack without game restart, **just start OneByteRadar.py again**.
